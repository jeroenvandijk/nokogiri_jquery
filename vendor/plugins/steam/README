Steam
=====

Steam is a headless integration testing tool driving HtmlUnit (http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/) (and at some point potentially other browsers) which enables testing JavaScript-driven web sites.

Concept
=======

Check out the pictures in the "doc" directory to get an idea how Steam is different from a classic (Webrat) Cucumber or Culerity setup.

Demo
====

You can find a demo application here:

  http://github.com/clemens/steam-demo

Installation
============

Steam currently has the following dependencies:

* Working Java Runtime
* RJB (if you're on OS X, see Troubleshooting section)

After that, installing Steam for a Rails project should be as simple as typing

  $ ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/svenfuchs/steam.git

Note: Since the HtmlUnit and all the JARs it depends on come packaged with Steam, the download might take a while.

Usage
=====

You can use Steam by itself as well as with Cucumber. You can find an example for a Cucumber setup in examples/cucumber/env.rb.

Steam is widely compatible with Webrat - many actions are implemented and take the same or very similar parameters as their Webrat equivalent. You should even be able to use the default webrat_steps.rb that ships with Cucumber.

Troubleshooting
===============

Installing RJB on Mac OS X:

The visudo way worked for us. Don't forget to add yourself to the sudoers file, though.

Acknowledgements
================

Kudos to Alexander Lang (http://github.com/langalex) for writing Culerity (http://github.com/langalex/culerity) which pioneered full-stack AJAX-enabled integration testing in Rails.
